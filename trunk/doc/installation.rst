Installation
============


Linux
-----
- The python and gdal version with Ubuntu 10.10 and 14.04 seem to work fine


Windows
-------
- install a recent python distribution, we recommend Anaconda as it contains most packages you need
- install GDAL including the python bindings. We have found that (Okt 2014) the gdal
  version in Anaconda itself is nto working properly so please use an alternate
  source. (we used http://gisinternals.com/sdk/PackageList.aspx?file=release-1500-x64-gdal-1-11-mapserver-6-4.zip)
